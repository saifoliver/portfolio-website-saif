    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I’m Mohammad Saif Uddin, a graduate student in Engineering Management who enjoys
      working where engineering, operations, and people meet. I like structure – clear
      goals, clear plans, clear communication – but I’m also comfortable dealing with real-world
      chaos and constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m especially interested in roles where I can help improve processes, support teams,
      and make decisions based on data and reality, not just spreadsheets.

    <h2>How I Work</h2>
    <p>
      I like breaking large problems into smaller, manageable steps and then mapping them in
      a simple plan or Gantt Chart. I ask questions early, prefer clear expectations, and
      believe that small adjustments over time are usually more realistic than big dramatic changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy collaborating with people who are direct, open to feedback, and serious
      about getting better, not just looking good.
